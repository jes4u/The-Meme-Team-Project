Our application takes in two twitter accounts’ latest 10 tweets and undergo a series of tests to provide users a graphic display of what the two twitter accounts’ personality type is. The tests that are being executed on the tweets are based off of the a personality application called “apply magic sauce”, which is used as “A personalisation engine that accurately predicts psychological traits from digital footprints of human behaviour”. The tweets are retrieved by using the Twitter API in combination with the TwitteR package, and the Big 5 personality traits are retrieved using the ApplyMagicSauce API.  We created a word cloud that displays the most used words of the two input twitter accounts. The other tabs contain a radar chart giving a graphical display of each Big 5 personality type, and tables giving Jungian personality traits (for example: INFJ). Our code works in RStudio, but ultimately is not compatible with an online Shiny app. Our AMS authentication token expired, and we have troubles generating a Twitter token via the Shiny app.
