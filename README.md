Our application takes in two twitter accounts’ latest 10 tweets and undergo a series of tests to provide users a graphic display of what the two twitter accounts’ personality type is. The tests that are being executed on the tweets are based off of the a personality application called “apply magic sauce”, which is used as “A personalisation engine that accurately predicts psychological traits from digital footprints of human behaviour”. The tweets are retrieved by using the Twitter API in combination with the TwitteR package, and the Big 5 personality traits are retrieved using the ApplyMagicSauce API.  We created a word cloud that displays the most used words of the two input twitter accounts and one using tweets from both users. The Big5 tab contains a radar chart giving a graphical display of each Big 5 personality type and the data tables that were generated by AMS. The Compatability tab gives Jungian personality traits (for example: INFJ) and generates a relationship compatability rating for the two users based on the mbti compatability chart.
