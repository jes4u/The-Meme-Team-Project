### The Meme Team

# Project Proposal

We will be working with the Apply Magic Sauce API that pulls information from a user's Facebook page and calculates various aspects of their personality.

Our target audience is anybody that uses Facebook.

Our audience wants to learn more about themselves and how accurate Facebook is on depicting their personalities.

Ex. questions:

* What are my biggest 5 personality scores?
* According to Facebook, how intelligent are they compared to eveyone else?
* Can Facebook determine whether you are satisfied with life?

#Technical Description

Our format will most likely be an HTML page.

We will be reading our data through an API (Apply Magic Sauce).

We will be both reshaping and reformatting the data we have. 

At the moment, we are not using/have found any new/major libraries besides what we have learned in class.

How accurately can a user's interactions on social media such as Facebook determine a person's personality, interests, religion, etc.?

Some major challenges we anticipate while doing the project:

* Comparing multiple user's data where an information/variables appears in some user's accounts and not others.

* Dealing with a user's change of character over time and depicting a user's change in ideals.

* Determining what kind of data is useful for determining a person's character.
